            <h5>God's mirror</h5>
            <p> we can reflect Jesus<br>
                mirror his love and care<br>
                So that when others see us<br>
                our savior will be there</p>

            <p>for if we love the widow<br>
                and care for those in need<br>
                we show them our savior<br>
                through our every deed</p>

            <p>Our job is very simple<br>
                His love so very clear<br>
                All we must do is reflect it<br>
                so it shines throughout the sphere</p>

        <h2>Science</h2>
        <p>In meteorology, a cloud is a visible mass of liquid droplets or frozen crystals made of water or various chemicals suspended in the atmosphere above the surface of a planetary body. These suspended particles are also known as aerosols and are studied in the cloud physics branch of meteorology.</p>

        <p>Terrestrial cloud formation is the result of air in Earth's atmosphere becoming saturated due to either or both of two processes: cooling of the air and adding water vapor. With sufficient saturation, precipitation will fall to the surface.</p>
